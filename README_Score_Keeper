# Ping Pong Score Keeper

## Project Description
This is a small JavaScript-based scorekeeper project simulating a ping pong game. Two players compete to reach a predefined score first, and the game keeps track of their progress. The first player to reach the target score wins, and the score display reflects the winner's success with color-coded results.

## Features
- Player 1 and Player 2 buttons to increment the score.
- Dropdown to set the winning score (between 3 and 11).
- The game disables buttons once a player wins, highlighting the winner in green and the loser in red.
- Reset button to start a new game at any point.
